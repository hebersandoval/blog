## Welcome to my simple blog application.

Here I will build a MVC Sinatra Application, that uses multiple models with validations, uses at least one `has_many` relationship, has an account user.

#### Description

This simple blog application has a login/signup page. Once an account has been created, a post can be composed and save. Also, a particular post can be edited or deleted. Enjoy posting!
